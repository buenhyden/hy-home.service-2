# Examples Directory

This directory is intentionally left empty.

## Why?

In the **Init-Project-Template**, examples are generated **dynamically** based on
your specific implementation plan and technology stack, rather than providing
stale static code.

## How to Generate an Example

1. Create a Spec: `specs/my-example/plan.md`
2. Run Setup: `./scripts/setup-workspace.ps1 specs/my-example/plan.md`

This ensures that every example you work with is compliant with the latest Rules
in `.agent/rules`.
