# Project Overview

## 🚀 Mission

The **Init-Project-Template** is a standardized, AI-optimized project template
designed for high-fidelity agentic software development. It provides a robust
foundation for building applications with the assistance of AI coding agents,
utilizing a **Modular Monolith** architecture for maximum evolution.

## 💡 Philosophy: AI-Optimized Development (AOD)

This project is built on the premise that modern software development is a
collaborative effort between human developers and AI coding agents. Unlike
traditional templates, this project is designed from the ground up to be
"Agent-Parseable."

### Core Principles

1. **Rule-Governed Execution**: Actions are not arbitrary; they are governed by
   160+ master rules indexed by IDs (e.g., `[REQ-0130-01]`).
2. **Standardized Skeletons**: Rules follow an 8-section skeleton, providing
   consistent context for AI agents.
3. **Strategic Alignment**: Every feature is grounded in a clear vision,
   specific success metrics, and a defined milestone roadmap, ensuring business
   value is trackable.
4. **Context Preservation**: Every technical decision is recorded (**ADRs**), implementations are documented (**ARDs**), and features are specified (**PRDs/Specs**), ensuring agents always have the necessary ground truth from problem definition to implementation pattern.
5. **5-Pillar Governance**: Project stability is maintained through distinct
   technical pillars: Standards, Workflows, Security/QA, Tech Stack, and
   Operations/Monitoring.
6. **Root-Level Blueprints**: Master governance is anchored in root files:
   `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, and `COLLABORATING.md`.

## 🔑 Key Features

* **🤖 Agent-Ready**: Built-in specialized personas and a massive rule
  repository for deterministic AI reasoning.
* **🏛️ Multi-Pillar Governance**: Strict engineering standards across
  Engineering, Workflows, Security, and Stack.
* **⚡ Orchestration-First**: Unified shell and PowerShell scripts for
  language-agnostic setup and workspace management.
* **📝 Documentation-Driven**: 4-pillar documentation hierarchy: **PRD** (What), **Architecture Blueprint** (Vision), **ADR** (Why), and **ARD** (How) for total traceability.
* **🛡️ Secure by Default**: Integrated security governance and QA protocols.
