# How-To Doc Creation Workflow

Based on `805-docs-howto-specific.md`.

1. **Input Analysis**
    - Read Technical Source (Test Script, API Spec, User Story).
    - Identify the **User Goal** (e.g., "Log In").

2. **Drafting - Structure**
    - Create Title: "How To [Goal]".
    - Write Intro: 1 sentence on purpose.
    - List Prerequisites.

3. **Drafting - Steps**
    - Convert technical steps to user actions.
    - `page.click('#btn')` -> "Click the **Button**."
    - Simplify language (No jargon).

4. **Verification Section**
    - Add "Expected Result".
    - "You should see..."

5. **Review**
    - Check against "Non-Technical Persona".
    - Is it simple? Is it actionable?
