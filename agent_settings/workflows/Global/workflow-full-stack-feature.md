# Full-Stack Feature Workflow

Orchestrates the lifecycle of a new feature from design to deployment.

1. **Design & Specification**
    - Confirm the feature PRD exists and is **Approved**: `docs/prd/<feature>-prd.md`.
    - Create/update the feature spec: `specs/<feature>/spec.md` (MUST reference the PRD and include traceability IDs).
    - Define QA upfront in the spec and treat it as a test backlog:
      - Complete `templates/spec-template.md` Section 0 (Quality/Testing/Security checklist).
      - Complete Spec Section 7 (Verification Plan: Unit/Integration/E2E/Load + coverage targets). Use `N/A (reason: ...)` when not applicable.
    - If a significant decision is required, create an ADR in `docs/adr/` and link it from the spec.
    - If you introduce a reusable implementation pattern, create/update an ARD in `docs/ard/` and link it from the spec.
    - Call `/workflow-api-design` to define the contract.
    - Create `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-spec.yml` ticket.

2. **Backend Implementation**
    - Call `/workflow-feature-component` for backend structure.
    - Implement Service/Controller layers (Ref: `200-Backend`).
    - Implement Database migrations (Ref: `300-Data_AI`).
    - Implement Unit/Integration tests from the Spec Verification Plan (Section 7).
    - Call `/workflow-testing` for Unit/Integration test setup and execution.

3. **Frontend Implementation**
    - Call `/workflow-feature-component` for frontend structure.
    - Implement Components/Pages (Ref: `100-Frontend`).
    - Integrate with Backend API.
    - Implement Component/E2E tests from the Spec Verification Plan (Section 7).
    - Call `/workflow-testing` for Component/E2E test setup and execution.

4. **Review & Refine**
    - Call `/workflow-pr-review` guideline.
    - Call `/workflow-refactoring` if code quality issues found.
    - Call `/workflow-performance-optimization` to check impact.

5. **Documentation**
    - Call `/workflow-docs-update` to update API docs and User guides.
    - Run docs validation: `./scripts/validate-docs.ps1 -Strict` (Windows) or `./scripts/validate-docs.sh --strict` (Unix).

6. **Merge & Deploy**
    - Trigger CI/CD pipeline.
    - Ensure quality gates pass (tests + coverage + docs/spec validation).
    - Call `/workflow-release`.
