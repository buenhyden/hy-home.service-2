# Agile Epic & Story Workflow

Based on `026-pm-epic-template.md`.

1. **Epic Definition**
    - **Goal**: Define the "Why" and "What" at a high level.
    - **Action**: Create a Markdown file (e.g., `docs/epics/EPIC-001-Auth.md`).
    - **Content**: Fill in Strategic Context, KPIs, and Scope.

2. **Story Breakdown (Slicing)**
    - **Goal**: Break Epic into sprint-sized deliverables.
    - **Action**: List "Candidate Stories" in the Epic file.
    - **Verify**: Are they INVEST? (Independent, Valuable...)?

3. **Detailed Story Specification**
    - **Goal**: Ready for Dev.
    - **Content**:
      - **Narrative**: User Persona + Action + Benefit.
      - **AC**: Checkbox list of verification steps.
      - **DoD**: Standard quality checks (Tests, A11y).

4. **Review**
    - **Stakeholders**: Confirm Business Value.
    - **Engineering**: Confirm Technical Feasibility and Estimates.
